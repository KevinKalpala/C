### **1️⃣ What the error was**

The original error was:

```
error: gpg failed to sign the data
error making request: 403 | Author is invalid
fatal: failed to write commit object
```

* **`gpg failed to sign the data`**: Git was trying to **sign your commit locally** using GPG.
* **`403 | Author is invalid`**: GitHub rejected the signed commit because **Git couldn’t produce a valid signature**, or the author email didn’t match your GitHub account.

Essentially, GitHub couldn’t verify your commit because either:

1. **No GPG key existed locally** (like in your Codespace, `.gnupg` was empty), or
2. **The commit email didn’t match** a GitHub-verified email, or
3. **Git was trying to sign by default**, even though no signing setup was ready.

---

### **2️⃣ Why it happens in Codespaces / fresh environments**

* In a fresh Codespace, **Git sometimes has `commit.gpgsign=true` by default** (or via Codespace templates).
* At the same time, **no GPG key exists yet** (`~/.gnupg` was empty).
* Git tries to sign the commit → fails → GitHub sees a commit with **invalid/missing signature** → returns 403.

---

### **3️⃣ How disabling signing fixes it**

When you run:

```bash
git config --local commit.gpgsign false
```

* Git stops trying to sign the commit.
* Commits are made normally, and GitHub associates them with your **GitHub email**, which is enough for Codespace commits to be **verified automatically** via GitHub’s own system.
* That’s why your commits now work without errors.

---

### **💡 Key takeaway**

* **GPG signing is optional** — GitHub can mark commits as verified even if you don’t have a local key, **as long as the email is recognized**.
* Errors like this often appear in **fresh environments**, automated setups, or cloud IDEs where GPG hasn’t been configured.
